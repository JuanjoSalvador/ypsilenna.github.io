When I started playing WoW as a teen, I misunderstood many things because my English was poor. For example, I thought that "Arms" is a bodybuilder spec for warriors who only do their upper half in the gym and the opposite would be "Legs". 
It took me a while to realize that arms means weapons, lol<br><br>

...you can imagine the mental image my teenage self had upon hearing "disarmed"
