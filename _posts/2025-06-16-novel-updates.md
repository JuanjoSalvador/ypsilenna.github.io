Hello, hello\
I am here to provide you with some information about my current novel in progress, The Snake Queen.\
It is currently being rewritten to improve the quality of the story as whole. Once I am done with that, I will decorate it with illustrations and most likely publish it on itch.io.\
The novel will be purchasable!; the initial plan is that it would cost about ‚Ç¨10 with an option to buy a cheaper version without illustrations and/or an extra pack of content (wallpapers, avatars, etc.).\
The story itself follows the misadventures of an ill-fated priestess who ended up trading her entire previous life for a celestial power and now has to live with the consequences.\

# Highlighted characters:
<br>

Raajimera: Aforementioned priestess. She has had amnesia ever since she made a deal with the sinister sky serpent.
<br>

Feng: A small feral snake. Able to communicate with Raajimera due to her newfound demigod powers. Quite silly.
<br>

Seyed: A handsome athlete from Duskvale village. He seems to have a crush on Raajimera, but perhaps some things indeed are too good to be true.
<br>

Aya: A kind village girl with access to a suspiciously out-of-place storage room.
<br>

Zephyr: A mysterious figure of the Howling Pass. Many anxiously seek his presence in the shadows. They know what they did.
<br>
# Further info:

The story should be approximately 10 chapters long, with no sequels planned (the ending I decided to go for will make it impossible to write one anyway).<br>
Unlike the first draft, the final version won't be hosted anywhere for free. I initially didn't want to paywall my own content, but the overwhelming number of people who save other people's writing for machine learning purposes is upsetting for me. If you cannot afford the asking price for the full story, I will certainly have sales and giveaways, so it's possible to get a discount or even a free copy during an event. I would just feel horrible if, after all of this work spent on developing my stories, somebody just benefitted from it for free.<br>
I hope you understand! If you wish to follow the development of my novel, you can do so on my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ypsilenna.art). <br>
<br>
Until we meet again!
