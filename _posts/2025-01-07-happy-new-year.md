Hello everyone! Happy 2025!
As you can see, I progressed with this site a bit. The galleries are fully functional (although I still got to work on some things).
From other news, I moved to Spain! I hope with this new life I will get new energy for creating and I can give you move stories and more artworks.... speaking of which, my novel The Snake Queen is almost ready! You can read it [here](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/1317686/the-snake-queen/)
I am sort of active on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ypsilenna.art) and [Mastodon 1](https://social.vivaldi.net/@Ypsilenna)/[Mastodon 2](https://mastodon.social/@Ypsilenna), feel free to follow me there if you wish to see my posts more often!
